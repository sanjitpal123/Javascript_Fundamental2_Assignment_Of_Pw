    <h2> Q.Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
        or odd using the ternary operator.</h2>
    <p>
        The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It provides a compact syntax for evaluating a condition and returning one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false. The ternary operator is often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements.

        Syntax of the Ternary Operator:

        condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
        If the condition is true, the expression before the colon (:) is evaluated.
        If the condition is false, the expression after the colon (:) is evaluated.

        Example: Checking Whether a Number is Even or Odd using the Ternary Operator:
        Program to check if a number is even or odd using the ternary operator

        let number = 17;

        let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";

        console.log(`The number ${number} is ${result}.`);
        In this example:
        The condition (number % 2 === 0) checks if the remainder when number is divided by 2 is equal to 0, which indicates an even number.
        If the condition is true, the expression before the colon ("Even") is evaluated and assigned to the variable result.
        If the condition is false, the expression after the colon ("Odd") is evaluated and assigned to the variable result.
        The program then prints a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
        You can change the value of the number variable to test the program with different input values.

        This is a concise way to express a simple conditional check. However, for more complex conditions or multiple branches, using an if-else statement may be more readable.
