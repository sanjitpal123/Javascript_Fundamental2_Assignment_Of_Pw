    <h2>Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the
        person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.</h2>
    <p>
        Certainly! You can use a ternary operator to check the eligibility of a person to vote based on their age. Here's an example in JavaScript:
        let age = 20;
        let eligibilityMessage = age < 18 ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";
        console.log(eligibilityMessage);
        In this example:
        The condition age < 18 checks if the person's age is less than 18.
        If the condition is true, it returns the string "You cannot vote."
        If the condition is false, it returns the string "You can vote."
        You can modify the value of the age variable to test the program with different ages. The ternary operator provides a concise way to express conditional statements and is suitable for simple checks like this one.
