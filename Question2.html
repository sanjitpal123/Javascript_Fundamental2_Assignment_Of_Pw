    <h2>Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.</h2>
    <p>
        The comma operator in JavaScript allows you to combine multiple expressions into a single statement. It evaluates each expression from left to right, returning the value of the last expression. While it may not be as commonly used as other operators, the comma operator can be handy in situations where you want to include multiple expressions within a single statement.

        Syntax of the Comma Operator:
        expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN;
        The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
        The value of the entire expression is the value of the last expression.
        Example: Using the Comma Operator:
        let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

        // The comma operator is used in the initialization of the variable 'd'
        let d = (a++, b++, c++);

        console.log(a); // Output: 2
        console.log(b); // Output: 3
        console.log(c); // Output: 4
        console.log(d); // Output: 3 (the value of the last expression 'c++')
        In this example:The variables a, b, and c are initialized using the comma operator in a single let statement.
        The comma operator is also used in the initialization of the variable d.
        The expressions (a++, b++, c++) involve the incrementing of a, b, and c by 1.
        The value of d is the value of the last expression c++, which is 3.
        While the use of the comma operator in this example may not be necessary, it can be more beneficial in situations where you need to combine multiple expressions within a single statement, such as in complex loop conditions or function arguments. However, it's essential to use it judiciously, as excessive use can lead to code that is harder to read and understand.
