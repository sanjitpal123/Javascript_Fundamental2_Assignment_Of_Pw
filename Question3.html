    <h2>Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
        “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.</h2>
    <p>
        Certainly! You can use a nested ternary operator to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. Here's an example in JavaScript:
        let number = -5;

        let result = number > 0
                ? "positive"
                : number < 0
                ? "negative"
                : "zero";

        console.log(`The number is ${result}.`);
        In this example:

        The first condition (number > 0) checks if the number is greater than 0. If true, it returns "positive."
        If the first condition is false, the second condition (number < 0) checks if the number is less than 0. If true, it returns "negative."
        If both conditions are false, it means the number is equal to 0, and the third part ("zero") is returned.
        You can change the value of the number variable to test the program with different input values. This nested ternary operator is a compact way to express the logic for checking the sign of a number.
